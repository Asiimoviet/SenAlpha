Automatically convert your school schedule from excel file to iCalendar file that you can easily import to third-party calendar services like Google Calendar with one configuration

## How to Use

First of all, open the config json file, and edit the classes group to the classes you have chosen (remember to exclude the teacher, because they might change and the program won't be able to pick up the class if that happened since the string won't match up)
Secondly, see if the days group matches the format of your schedule excel.
Then, enjoy the easy converter for all your schedule files :)
